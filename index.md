## Summary

I'm a senior/lead developer with 14 years experience of designing and developing reliable, scalable applications and APIs.
I've written code that correctly handles tens of thousands of operations per second, provided technical 
leadership and mentorship for agile teams, and worked with other development teams and organisations, product owners, and customers to make sure the right thing gets built in a maintainable way. 
I have a passion for learning, for solving interesting problems, and for building things that make people's life better.
