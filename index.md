### Experience

#### EXFO Nova Context (2017 - present)

EXFO's Nova Context product uses a large (up to 1TB) in-memory graph database to allow network operators to infer relationships between essentially any entity or device in a network, drawing from databases, events and unstructured data to build the model.

##### Senior Software Engineer / Lead Architect (May 2017 - present)

In the EXFO Nova Context teams, I am one of the most senior developers and the lead architect for the Nova Context product. In this role, I have been responsible for:

* **Developing Application Features:** Developed features for both the front- and back-end portions of the Nova Context product, as part of an agile team.

* **Driving Containerization Efforts:** I am currently driving efforts to allow the platform to be packaged and deployed into customer datacentres as OCI containers, to allow for easier, machine-agnostic deployments, faster test cycles, and less disruptive upgrades.

* **Architectural Representative:** As the division's lead architect, I represent the Nova Context teams in an EXFO-wide architectural forum. This involves sharing interesting development and technologies with the rest of EXFO, working with the architectural group to develop new company-wide best practises, and driving adoption of those recommendations where sensible.

* **Worked to Develop Microservice Recommendations:** I am part of a small subset of architects developing and maintaining recommendations and examples for teams looking to move to a more microservice-oriented, Kubernetes-based architecture.

* **Ran K8s Dojos/Workshops:** I ran a workshop with the rest of the architectural group to give people a chance to try putting these recommendations into practice, using an example microservice project and the k3s Kubernetes micro-distributution.

* **Developed Team Tooling:** As part of the team, I've written a few different tools to automate various parts of the development process, including the release process, running VM-based smoke tests, packaging the application and building a deployable Docker image.

#### Mendeley / Elsevier (2016 - 2017)

Mendeley is an Elsevier-owned company that offers social networking and reference citation services for academic researchers, deployed on AWS infrastructure.

##### Principal Software Engineer / Technical Lead (May 2016 - May 2017)

During my time at Mendeley, I was the technical lead of the Authentication & Onboarding team. This team was responsible for developing and supporting HA REST APIs and services that provided the Mendeley-wide authentication and authorization mechanisms (based on OAuth), registration and on-boarding of new users, and general account management facilities (forgot password, invitations, etc). As well as providing leadership and mentorship for more junior developers on the team, I was responsible for:

 * **Architected SSO Migration:** Led design and worked with the team on developing and implementing a plan for the migration of Mendeley's self-hosted sign-in flow to an Elsevier-managed single sign-in system based on OpenID Connect.

 * **Developed Features:** Worked in an agile environment to deliver features, bug fixes, RESTful APIs and services as part of the authentication and authorization Java backend development team.

 * **Acted as a Technical Point Of Contact:** Acted as the technical point-of-contact for the team, providing advice and guidance to other teams in Mendeley and Elsevier relating to authentication and security implementations.

#### OpenMarket (2007 - 2016)

OpenMarket is a mobile aggregator, providing global SMS messaging to enterprise clients. During my time at OpenMarket, I primarily worked on teams that developed and maintained the core messaging platforms and supporting tools.

##### Software Development Manager (Oct 2015 – May 2016):

In 2015-2016, I acted as a development manager for a new development team, which involved line management responsibities, hiring new developers, and working with senior leadership to define priorities for the company-wide SMS platform.

##### Technical Team Lead (Sept 2013 – Oct 2015):

In 2013, I became technical lead of the SMS platform team. In addition to continuing feature development, I took a more active role in mentorship, training and advising more junior developers.

As the platform began to hit scalability limits, I designed and worked with other team members to prototype and develop a replacement system and architecture that would allow it to scale to meet forseeable needs by removing critical bottlenecks and scaling horizontally.

##### Software Developer / Senior Software Developer (July 2007 – Sept 2013):

At OpenMarket, I joined as a Java developer, primarily working on the team that handled development and maintenance of the SMS message routing, delivery and billing platform. This platform was core to the company, processing several thousands to tens of thousands of messaging transactions per second. To achieve these rates, the platform was heavily concurrent, and distributed across machines.

I also acted as a point of contact, providing advice and assistance to both internal teams (technical and non-technical), and externally for a few high-profile, high-traffic customers.

### Education

* **University of Warwick (2003-2007):** Graduated with a 2:1 Masters degree in Computer Science
* **Wisbech Grammar School (1996-2003):** 3 A-Levels, 1 AS Level
